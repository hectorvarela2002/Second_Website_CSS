I am currently a Life Scout in <a href="https://www.troopwebhost.org/Troop461Covina/" target="_blank">Troop 461</a> located out of Covina.</h2>

				<h2 style="color:#5472a5;">In my free time I enjoy airsofting, hangning out with friends and family, and fishing. I don't go airsofting as much as I used to but it is still one of my favorite things to do. Here at Damien, I am the President of the Fishing Club and we go on monthly deep sea fishing trips.</h2>
